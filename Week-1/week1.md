Week 1: Bytewise Fellowship

During the first week of the Bytewise Fellowship program, we were introduced to the fellowship program and had a discussion on the rules and regulations that govern it. We also had an opportunity to get to know one another and share our backgrounds and interests.

One of the highlights of the week was a survey that was conducted to determine the level of proficiency of each fellow in the program. From the survey, it was discovered that most of us were either intermediate or beginners, with one fellow (which was me) having a master level of proficiency in the field.

As the only master-level fellow, I was able to have a meeting with the program lead, during which we discussed my expectations and goals for the program. This meeting was very insightful and helped me to understand how best to utilize the resources provided by the program.
